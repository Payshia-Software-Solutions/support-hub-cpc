// This file is used to declare modules that don't have typescript declarations
// in @types.

// If you are seeing an error like "Cannot find module 'buffer' or its corresponding
// type declarations.", it is likely because you are importing a module that
// does not have type declarations. You can add a declaration for the module
// here.

// For example, to declare a module named "buffer", you would add the following
// line:
// declare module "buffer";
declare module "wav";
